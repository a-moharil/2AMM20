# 2AMM20
This repository consists of the codes for the project created during the course 2amm20.

  1) BERT_Polysemy-Biomedical.py is the final code of our approach to obtain contextual cluster files.
  
  2) Result_link.md consists of the Google Drive link where all the obtained results of the experimentations are uploaded.
## BERT_POLYSEMY-BIOMEDICAL.PY
After running the .py file the user will be presented to input some arguments. We explain these arguments below:-
1) "Enter the number of target terms that you wish to disambiguate" :- The user shall enter the integer terms planned to disambiguate.
2) "Enter the target term" :- The user shall enter the target term (string input).
3) "Enter input for a starting label for which the threshold plot is to be obtained " :- The user shall input an arbitary label (int) for the target term t for which they wish to see a threshold plot. The plots will be created from "starting label" to "ending label" (which will be the consecutive argument.) 
4)
